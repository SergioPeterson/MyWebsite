Congratulations! You have found my hidden blog. This blog is not advertised or
linked to from anywhere on my site so you must have been snooping around. It is
a hidden gem that only the most curious and adventurous visitors will discover.

<!-- more -->

I'm not sure what I will use this blog for yet, but I'm thinking it will be a
place for me to share personal stories, thoughts, and reflections that don't
quite fit into the rest of my site.

For those curious, this blog is built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a
static site generator written in Rust, because I am too lazy to write the code
myself (**The three chief virtues of a programmer are: Laziness, Impatience and
Hubris" - Larry Wall**). The theme is a custom Zola theme called
["After After Dark"](https://github.com/micahkepe/after-after-dark)
that I made based off the
[`after-dark` theme](https://github.com/getzola/after-dark).
